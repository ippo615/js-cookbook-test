js-cookbook-test
================

A library for testing and creating samples of your javascript code.

Try it: http://ippo615.github.io/js-cookbook-test

I did not like how the testing libraries I looked at only showed the
results of each test. I wanted to see the code samples and my explainations
of them. js-cookbook-test enables you to see to the test code and the
test results. It gives you a test suite and a collection of easy
to copy code.

The library is meant to be small. It is lacking a good deal of features
that other libraries have.

The meat of the library is in `js-cookbook-test.js` but I would just 
copy the entire git repository and modify the `index.html` file to 
include whatever js code you want to test and write the tests directly
in `index.html`.
